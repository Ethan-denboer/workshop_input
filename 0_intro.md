# Welcome to this XML course

### Abstract
This course is designed for students and employees of Digital Heritage institutes that working with XML and seek for ways to 
automatically extract content and metadata from these XML files. 

In this course, students learn the basics of the XML format and how to extract information from them with three various Python packages: ElementTree and Beautiful Soap. We will work with the three XML formats that are commonly provided by the KB, the national library of the Netherlands: Alto, XML and Page. 

The course is structured als follows:

### Course description
This course is set up to be a quick-start into working with XML files using Python. No prior knowledge of Python or XML is needed as the first lessons cover the basics of working with Python in Jupyter Notebooks as well as the basics of XML structure. Which is then followed by an introduction to common XML formats in humanities and two Python packages for working with XLM. After this, some practical sessions follow to apply the obtained knowledge to a simple example XML using both packages. 
With this as a solid basis the course dives into the extraction of information from real-life XML files kindly supplied by the KB, National Library of the Netherlands. 
The three real-life XML-files are processed using both packages to show the differences, and to provide working code blocks to base future work on.
Because of this format, there is some repetition between chapters. 
It is possible to follow only the ElementTree or the Beautiful Soup lessons as the structure of both tracks is the same. For those without any background in Python or XML, or in need of a refresher course, we recommend to start from lesson one. For those with a background in either Python or XML, feel free to deep-dive into the later lessons and skip the introductions.
